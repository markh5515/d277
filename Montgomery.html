    <h1>Montgomery</h1>
    <p>Montgomery is the capital city of Alabama. It is an urban city located in the central part of the state on the Alabama River. 
      Montgomery was incorporated on December 3rd, 1819. 
      During the War of Northern Agression, Montgomery became the capital of the Confederacy. The city was later captured by the Union army in April of 1865.
    Post World-War II, Montgomery became a hotbed for the civil rights movement.
    In December of 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give her seat on a bus to a white passenger, which led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
    In June of 1956a federal judge ruled that the bus segregation laws were unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court upheld the ruling later that year.
      In recent years Montgomery has been nationally recognized for its downtown revitalization projects. With rising demands for housing, the city has more than 500 apartment buildings planned or under construction. They have also opened a fifty million dollar water park, and a new minor league baseball stadium. The city's median income is $49,989, which is just under one thousand dollars less than the state's $50,910.
